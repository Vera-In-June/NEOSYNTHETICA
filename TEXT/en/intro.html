<p>Hello! My name is Claire but most call me Claire. I am an artist of many mediums, studying my <i>Bachelors Degree in Social Sciences at the University of Waikato</i>, and I'm Double Majoring in <b>Psychology</b> and <b>Linguistics</b>. In my time spent outside of study, I like to hone my skills as a multimedia artist, in areas such as concept design, animation, 3D animation, 3D modelling, scene design, sound design, and scoring, I specialize in the use of Blender, the Adobe suite, and Ableton for my work. If you can't tell, I also have much experience with translation and web design! I am adept in French, Chinese, and MƒÅori, and studying Japanese, and in my other list of languages, we have Javascript, Python, and some Lua. Please get in contact if you wish to work with me... for a price...</p>
